                As a graduate of computer applications I am a highly curious person who is always looking for something new <br> to explore I like to create projects of differents topics on Information Technology <br> such as Networking, Security, Troubleshooting,
                Coding, Web development projects in order to test <br> and discover more knowledge of computer science until I get a entry level position from I could continue <br> serving the organization I am working with, by solving real world problem
                in helping that organization <br> to prosper and at the grow my community by exchange culture, while moving towards a promising future.
